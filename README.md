# ProjectPlanner
A lightweight project planner (vanilla JS + json‑server) where you create projects, define phases and work packages, auto-schedule them with weekly capacities, and manage/visualize progress via tables, charts, kanban, and exports (CSV/MD/PDF, multi-chart PDF). It also includes a per-project work journal stored locally with quick exports.
